			<b>About the Symposium</b>
			<p>
				Materials plays an indispensable role in our day to day lives. Infact advancement in the development of novel materials played a crucial role in enhancing the quality of our life. Advanced materials offer developments in healthcare, agriculture and  energy (generation, capture and storage). IIT Mandi realised the potential role of materials research in its early stages itself and invested heavily in creating manpower and infrastructure and established an advanced materials research centre (AMRC). The national symposium is being organised to discuss about the developments in this rapidly advancing frontier area of research. Speakers are drawn from a rich pool of pioneering scientists from across the country. The participants will have the opportunity not only to learn about the latest advancements in the field from top notch scientists, but also to present their own work as posters and network with their peers.
